### Materials
- In this section, you will explore the material of your object and have the ability to assign different shaders as desired. With the use of this addon, specifically the principled bsdf shader, you can achieve your painterly effect on your object's surface.

### Brush
- This section aims to provide a definition of the brush being used,  including the option to customize it by using an image.
  
### Color Picker
- In this section lets you pick the first and second color component (you can switch it by typing __X__, the slider with a gradient in the background lets you define the third color component.

### Layers
- Layers will create another image and you can assigned different colors and brushes that you want to paint and also avoids mixing your hand painted work

### Color Palette 
- Color palettes provide a method for storing and organizing the colors of a brush, allowing them to be easily accessed and reused later on. This functionality proves particularly beneficial when working with multiple colors simultaneously, as it enables efficient color management throughout the creative process
